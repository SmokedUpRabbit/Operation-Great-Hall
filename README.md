# Project Lighthouse: The Ledger (v0.1.0)

## Mission
To create a transparent, voluntary, open-source tool that allows an individual to calculate a real-world monetary estimate of their public social media engagement, fostering digital awareness and sovereignty.

## Core Principles
1.  **User Sovereignty:** You own your data. This tool will never store or transmit your personal credentials or tokens. All calculations happen on your device.
2.  **Complete Transparency:** This project is fully open-source. Every line of code, including the valuation model, is public and available for audit.
3.  **Empowerment Through Data:** We believe that by showing people the tangible value of their digital labor, we can start a movement towards a more equitable digital economy.

## Architecture Overview
"The Ledger" is built on a modular, client-side-first architecture:
-   **AuthHandler (The Locksmith):** Securely handles authentication via device keychain.
-   **DataScraper (The Scout):** Fetches public engagement metrics using your credentials.
-   **ValuationEngine (The Accountant):** Applies a transparent heuristic model to calculate value.
-   **Dashboard (The Cockpit):** The user interface that brings all modules together.

## How to Contribute
This is a project for everyone. We welcome contributions in the form of code, documentation, and improved valuation models. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details.

### Our Purpose
This is not simply a tool for truth. **It is a tool designed to dismantle the model of extractive corporate profit and empower individuals to reclaim the value they create.** It is the first step in building a system where profit is distributed back to its people.
